## Movie Recommendation System

A content-based Movie Recommendation System built using NLP and machine learning techniques. Given a movie title, the system suggests 8 similar movies based on plot, genre, director, and lead actors.

### 🚀 Features

- Accepts movie titles as user input
- Recommends 8 similar movies using:
  - Movie Overview
  - Genre
  - Top 4 actors
- Text preprocessing with NLTK
- TF-IDF vectorization & cosine similarity for recommendations
- Deployed with Flask
- Ready for hosting on Render

### 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Flask 🌐
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
- HTML & CSS (for UI)

### 💡 How It Works

1. **Input**: User enters a movie title
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean overview, genre, director, and actors
3. **Feature Engineering**: Combine all into one text string
4. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert text into numeric vectors
5. **Cosine Similarity**: Find movies most similar to the input
6. **Output**: Top 8 recommendations displayed on the results page
