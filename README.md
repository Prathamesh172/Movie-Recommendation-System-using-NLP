### üß† Model Overview

The classifier is a **multi-class Logistic Regression model** trained on labeled product reviews.

Steps:
1. Clean review and summary text
2. Combine them for richer context
3. Vectorize using **TF-IDF**
4. Predict using **Logistic Regression**

Prediction Labels:
- `0` ‚Üí Negative
- `1` ‚Üí Neutral
- `2` ‚Üí Positive

### üìä Dataset

*Describe the dataset here ‚Äî include source, number of records, preprocessing done, etc.*

> Example:
> The dataset used to train the model consists of ~25,000 labeled Amazon product reviews. Each review is labeled as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on its overall tone. Text was cleaned using regex, lowercasing, and token filtering. Summary and main review body were concatenated before vectorization.
